# Azuga Training

Hello and welcome to my Java training notes.

This repository contains Java codes for various scenarios and was created during Azuga's training phase under the direction of CodeOps. The codes were written over the course of four weeks and are available on the Github repository. They will be available for future referencing and upgrades. Any and all contributions are welcome.

## Requirements

There are no such prerequisites. Although, a suitable JDK (preferably JDK 11 or higher) and an IDE must be installed.

For simplicity, this project is built using the Gradle build tool on the IntelliJ IDE.

However, in order to expand on this project, a number of additional dependencies are needed which can be imported directly by build.gradle; a list of them is provided in the last section Dependencies.
All the necessary dependencies mentioned in the list must be imported for the programs to run error free.

## Installation

Install my-project using terminal

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining
  cd my-project
```
    
## Roadmap

The whole project is divided into weekly tasks and are as follows:

- [Week 1](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining/tree/Week1)
      Week 1's aim was to imitate the behaviour of CLI commands such as pwd, date, cd, mkdir, pipe, and so on.
   
- [Week 2](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining/tree/Week2)
      

- [Week 3](https://github.com/Aparajita1966/AzugaTraining/tree/Week3_Week4)
